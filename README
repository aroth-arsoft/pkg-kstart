DESCRIPTION

  k4start (for Kerberos v4) and k5start (for Kerberos v5) are modified
  versions of kinit.  They can be used as a substitute for kinit (with
  better command-line handling than the old Kerberos v4 kinit), but they
  can also obtain credentials automatically from a v4 srvtab or a v5
  keytab.  They can run as a daemon, waking up periodically to refresh
  credentials using that srvtab or keytab, and can also check for the
  validity of tickets and only refresh if they're no longer valid.

  Some of these capabilities have been included in Kerberos v5's kinit,
  but the ability to maintain tickets while running as a daemon has not
  and is useful for servers that need to use Kerberos.  Using kstart
  allows the ticket handling to be moved out of the server into a separate
  process dedicated just to that purpose.

  k4start and k5start can optionally run an external program whenever the
  ticket is refreshed to obtain an AFS token, and therefore can be used in
  conjunction with a program like aklog or afslog to maintain an AFS
  token.  When built with the (currently somewhat experimental) support
  for AFS PAGs, they can also put the program in its own PAG so that its
  authentication doesn't affect any other programs.

REQUIREMENTS

  As Kerberos programs, k4start and k5start require Kerberos libraries to
  link against.  They have only been thoroughly tested with the MIT
  Kerberos libraries, but should compile with Heimdal and KTH Kerberos v4.
  Unfortunately, k5start error reporting will be less than useful with
  Heimdal at present (patches that don't break MIT Kerberos are welcome).

  If you only have Heimdal but not KTH Kerberos v4, you can build only
  k5start with make k5start.

  Other than that, all you should need is a suitable C compiler.  Neither
  program has been tested on non-Unix systems.

  If you want the -t option to work, you need a program to obtain AFS
  tokens from Kerberos tickets.  You can specify the program to use on
  your system with the --with-aklog option to configure; if that option is
  not given, the first of aklog or afslog that is found on your path at
  configure time will be used.

  To enable the somewhat experimental support for AFS PAGs, pass the
  --with-afs-setpag flag to configure.  It is not enabled by default.
  Currently, this support requires the newer OpenAFS libraries
  (libafsauthent and libafsrpc) and pthreads (because those libraries
  require pthreads).  If your AFS libraries aren't in your standard search
  path, give the root of your AFS tree to --with-afs-setpag as an
  argument.  When enabled, k4start and k5start will always create a new
  PAG before authentication when running a specific command and when aklog
  is being run.

INSTALLATION

  Basic installation is simple.  Just run:

      ./configure
      make
      make install

  This will build k4start and k5start and install them in /usr/local/bin
  with man pages in /usr/local/man/man1.  You may need to be root to run
  make install.  To install in a different location, specify a different
  location with the --prefix option to configure, as in:

      ./configure --prefix=/opt/sw

  Binaries would then be installed in /opt/sw/bin and man pages in
  /opt/sw/man/man1.  Alternately, --bindir and --mandir can be given to
  change the installation locations of the binaries and manual pages
  separately.

  If your Kerberos libraries aren't installed in a location found by your
  compiler by default, use the --with-kerberos=PATH option to configure.
  The Kerberos libraries will then be expected in PATH/lib and the headers
  in PATH/include.

  If you are using aklog, afslog, or some other program to obtain AFS
  tokens, give its path to configure with the --with-aklog option, as in:

      ./configure --with-aklog=/usr/local/bin/aklog

  This program will be run when the -t option is given to k4start or
  k5start.

  To enable the AFS PAG support, pass --with-afs-setpag to configure.  You
  may need to specify the root of your AFS client tree if the AFS
  libraries aren't in the standard search path, such as with:

      ./configure --with-afs-setpag=/usr/afsws

  Finally, to link statically against the Kerberos libraries rather than
  dynamically (so that the binaries can be used on systems without
  Kerberos libraries installed, for example, or so that they're
  independent of shared libraries installed in AFS or NFS), give the
  --enable-static option to configure.  This has been tested on Solaris
  and Linux.
