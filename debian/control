Description: Kerberos kinit variant supporting ticket refreshing
 k5start (for Kerberos v5) and k4start (for Kerberos v4) can be used
 instead of kinit to obtain Kerberos tickets.  krenew can be used instead
 of kinit -R to renew renewable tickets.  They are intended primarily for
 use with automated or long-running processes and support some additional
 features useful for that purpose, such as running as a daemon and
 refreshing the ticket periodically, checking to see if an existing ticket
 has expired, or obtaining an AFS token along with the ticket by running
 an external program automatically.
