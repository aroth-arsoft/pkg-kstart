                       User-Visible kstart Changes

kstart 2.8 (unreleased)

    Added -b option to both k4start and k5start to background after the
    initial authentication, based on code by Navid Golpayegani.

kstart 2.7 (2005-06-04)

    Fixed a bug in k5start introduced in 2.4 that broke -H handling and
    getting a specific service ticket, and which caused k5start to make an
    additional bogus request for the wrong service on each authentication.

kstart 2.6 (2005-06-03)

    Finished the port to Heimdal.  k5start error reporting should now work
    correctly, as should handling of krb5.conf defaults.

    Added the -U flag to k5start, telling it to figure out the client
    principal by looking in the provided keytab rather than expecting it
    on the command line, making it easier to write scripts that use the
    system keytab.

    Added the --disable-k4start flag to configure to make it easier to
    build only k5start (particularly useful if one only has Heimdal and
    not KTH Kerberos).

kstart 2.5 (2005-05-01)

    Unless -k is given, k4start and k5start both now create a temporary
    ticket cache file with mkstemp and delete it on exit when running a
    command, to not interfere with other ticket caches owned by the same
    user.

    k5start now correctly sets KRB5CCNAME when running aklog or a
    command.

    Ported to Heimdal and KTH Kerberos, somewhat.  Error handling in
    k5start still won't produce good error messages because the
    differences between MIT and Heimdal are more profound than I can
    easily adjust for.

    Documentation improvements, particularly in the area of specifying
    commands to run.

kstart 2.4 (2005-04-25)

    Renamed kstart to k4start to avoid a conflict with a KDE program.
    This is more symmetric with k5start anyway.

    Added support to both k4start and k5start for running a program after
    obtaining Kerberos credentials and optionally AFS tokens.  This mode
    is like the -K mode, except that k4start or k5start will exit when the
    program it ran exits.  Added preliminary support for creating a PAG
    for the command to run in.

    Minor cleanups and bug fixes to both programs.  Exit earlier if unable
    to determine the principal, add newlines to the end of some verbose
    trace messages, and fix error reporting after Ctrl-C in k4start.

    Internal code refactoring, reorganization, and cleanup.

kstart 2.3 (2005-02-22)

    Fixed make install with a separate build directory.  The Makefile must
    look for the man pages in the source directory.

    Don't include Debian packaging rules in the standard distribution (per
    recommended best practices for maintaining Debian packages with rules
    in the upstream CVS).

kstart 2.2 (2004-07-29)

    Removed the various Stanford-specific banners that these programs
    inherited from our local kinit.  In normal use of kstart or k5start,
    there's no need to check for whether the session is encrypted (and the
    relevant environment variables are normally not set anyway).
    Similarly, since there's only one kstart and k5start, there isn't the
    need to distinguish from another by printing out a Stanford banner.

    Added Debian package build rules.

    Significantly improved the man pages.

    Substantial code cleanup of both kstart and k5start.  Both now follow
    my current C coding standards, include far less portability cruft, and
    include far fewer unnecessary headers.

kstart 2.1 (2002-12-29)

    No code changes.  Added a README file with installation instructions
    and a license.

kstart 2.0 (2002-12-29)

    First release that includes k5start, an equivalent version of kstart
    for Kerberos v5.

kstart 1.19 (2001-06-14)

    Added a fudge factor to make sure the ticket is refreshed before it
    expires.  The same factor also applies to -H, so -H will detect
    tickets that are about to expire.

kstart 1.17 (2001-01-16)

    Fixed a bug in obtaining a ticket from a srvtab.

kstart 1.16 (2000-10-17)

    Added the -H option to check whether a ticket has expired, and fix
    bugs in the detection of expired tickets.

kstart 1.13 (2000-04-19)

    Diagnose errors when running aklog.  Better portability and use of
    Autoconf.

kstart 1.10 (1999-09-01)

    Set KRBTKFILE when -k is used so that aklog can find the ticket.

kstart 1.8 (1997-10-17)

    Add support for long-term ticket maintenance as a daemon, the -K and
    -k options.

kstart 1.7 (1997-07-23)

    Change default location of aklog and documentation fixes.

kstart 1.5 (1996-04-10)

    Portability to Solaris.  Change the usage message to indicate that
    lifetime is in minutes, not seconds.

kstart 1.3 (1995-06-05)

    Add a password prompt for the -s option and remove implied -q.
