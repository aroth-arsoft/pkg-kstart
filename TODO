                            kstart To-Do List

General:

 * k4start, k5start, and krenew have almost identical structure.  Redesign
   them to use a standard driver frontend with callbacks for the things
   that differ between the three programs, which will significantly reduce
   code duplication.

 * KINIT_PROG is a lame environment variable for the AKLOG binary.  Also
   support something saner, like AKLOG.

k5start:

 * Add the -F and -P flags to k5start to override library defaults for
   forwardable and proxiable tickets.

 * Add support to k5start for obtaining K4 tickets in addition to K5
   tickets, using the DES key in a keytab.

Test suite:

 * Test more of krenew's basic functionality, preferrably by parsing klist
   output more thoroughly and seeing if tickets really were renewed.

 * Add tests for the daemon functionality (-b and -K) in k4start, k5start,
   and krenew.  Also test PID handling (-p and -c).

 * Add tests for running commands in k4start, k5start, and krenew,
   particularly propagation of signals, propagation of exit status, and
   waking up periodically while the command is running.

 * Add error tests for invalid combinations of command-line options or
   invalid settings for those options in k4start, k5start, and krenew.
