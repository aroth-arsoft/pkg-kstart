                       User-Visible kstart Changes

kstart 2.4 (2005-04-23)

    Rename kstart to k4start to avoid a conflict with a KDE program.  This
    is more symmetric with k5start anyway.

kstart 2.3 (2005-02-22)

    Fixed make install with a separate build directory.  The Makefile must
    look for the man pages in the source directory.

    Don't include Debian packaging rules in the standard distribution (per
    recommended best practices for maintaining Debian packages with rules
    in the upstream CVS).

kstart 2.2 (2004-07-29)

    Removed the various Stanford-specific banners that these programs
    inherited from our local kinit.  In normal use of kstart or k5start,
    there's no need to check for whether the session is encrypted (and the
    relevant environment variables are normally not set anyway).
    Similarly, since there's only one kstart and k5start, there isn't the
    need to distinguish from another by printing out a Stanford banner.

    Added Debian package build rules.

    Significantly improved the man pages.

    Substantial code cleanup of both kstart and k5start.  Both now follow
    my current C coding standards, include far less portability cruft, and
    include far fewer unnecessary headers.

kstart 2.1 (2002-12-29)

    No code changes.  Added a README file with installation instructions
    and a license.

kstart 2.0 (2002-12-29)

    First release that includes k5start, an equivalent version of kstart
    for Kerberos v5.

kstart 1.19 (2001-06-14)

    Added a fudge factor to make sure the ticket is refreshed before it
    expires.  The same factor also applies to -H, so -H will detect
    tickets that are about to expire.

kstart 1.17 (2001-01-16)

    Fixed a bug in obtaining a ticket from a srvtab.

kstart 1.16 (2000-10-17)

    Added the -H option to check whether a ticket has expired, and fix
    bugs in the detection of expired tickets.

kstart 1.13 (2000-04-19)

    Diagnose errors when running aklog.  Better portability and use of
    Autoconf.

kstart 1.10 (1999-09-01)

    Set KRBTKFILE when -k is used so that aklog can find the ticket.

kstart 1.8 (1997-10-17)

    Add support for long-term ticket maintenance as a daemon, the -K and
    -k options.

kstart 1.7 (1997-07-23)

    Change default location of aklog and documentation fixes.

kstart 1.5 (1996-04-10)

    Portability to Solaris.  Change the usage message to indicate that
    lifetime is in minutes, not seconds.

kstart 1.3 (1995-06-05)

    Add a password prompt for the -s option and remove implied -q.
