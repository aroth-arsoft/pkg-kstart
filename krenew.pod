=head1 NAME

krenew - Renew a Kerberos v5 ticket

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<krenew> [B<-bghtv>] [B<-K> I<minutes>] [B<-k> I<ticket file>]
    [B<-p> I<pid file>] [I<command> ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<krenew> renews an existing renewable ticket.  When run without any
arguments, it just attempts to renew the existing ticket-granting ticket
in the current ticket cache, equivalent to C<kinit -R>, but it can
optionally run a program like B<aklog> to refresh AFS tokens, can run as a
daemon and wake up periodically to renew the ticket cache, or can run a
specified command and keep renewing the ticket cache until the command
finishes (or renewal is no longer possible).  If a command is specified,
B<krenew> by default wakes up every 60 minutes (1 hour) to check the
ticket cache.

If a command is given, it will not be run using the shell, so if you want
to use shell metacharacters in the command with their special meaning,
give C<sh -c I<command>> as the command to run and quote I<command>.  If
the command contains command-line options (like C<-c>), put -- on the
command line before the beginning of the command to tell B<krenew> to not
parse those options as its own.

If B<krenew> is built with setpag support and AFS tokens are requested
with the B<-t> option, it will put the command in a separate PAG before
obtaining AFS tokens so that they don't interfere with other processes on
the system.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-b>

After starting, detach from the controlling terminal and run in the
background.  This option only makes sense in combination with B<-K> or a
command that B<krenew> will be running.  B<krenew> will not background
itself until after it does the initial ticket renewal, so that any initial
errors will be reported, but it will then redirect output to F</dev/null>
and no subsequent errors will be reported.

If used in conjunction with a command to run, that command will also run
in the background and will also have its input and output redirected to
F</dev/null>.  It will have to report any errors via some other mechanism
for the errors to be seen.

=item B<-g>
        
Make the resulting ticket group readable.  Some applications may not be
happy with a group readable ticket.

=item B<-h>

Display a usage message and exit.

=item B<-K> I<minutes>
	
Run in daemon mode to keep a ticket alive indefinitely.  The program
reawakens after I<minutes> minutes, checks if the ticket will expire
before the next wakeup, and renews the ticket if needed.  If this option
is not given but a command was given on the command line, the default
interval is 60 minutes (1 hour).

=item B<-k> I<ticket file>

Use I<ticket file> as the ticket cache rather than the contents of the
environment variable KRB5CCNAME or the library default.

=item B<-p> I<pid file>

Save the process ID (PID) of the running B<krenew> process into I<pid
file>.  I<pid file> is created if it doesn't exist and overwritten if it
does exist.  This option is most useful in conjunction with B<-b> to allow
management of the running B<krenew> daemon.

Note that, when used with B<-b> the PID file is written out after
B<krenew> is backgrounded and changes its working directory to F</>, so
relative paths for the PID file will be relative to F</> (probably not
what you want).

=item B<-t>
	
Run an external program after getting a ticket.  The default use of this
is to run B<aklog> to get a token.  If the environment variable KINIT_PROG
is set, it overrides the compiled-in default.

=item B<-v>
	
Be verbose.  This will print out a bit of additional information about
what is being attempted and what the results are.

=back

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The program normally exits with status 0 if it successfully renews a
ticket.  If B<krenew> runs aklog or some other program B<krenew> returns
the exit status of that program.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Renew the current ticket-granting ticket.

    krenew

Wake up every ten minutes and check to see if the ticket cache needs
renewing.  If it does, re-run B<aklog> as well.

    krenew -K 10 -t

Run the program F</usr/local/bin/compute-job> in the background, checking
every hour to see if the ticket needs to be renewed (the default).  Put
the PID of the B<krenew> job in F</var/run/compute.pid>.  Obtain a new AFS
token each time the ticket has to be renewed.

    krenew -b -t -p /var/run/compute.pid /usr/local/bin/compute-job

If you wanted to pass options to F</usr/local/bin/compute-job>, putting a
C<--> argument before it would be necessary to keep B<krenew> from
interpreting those options as its own.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

If the environment variable KINIT_PROG is set to a program (such as
B<aklog>) then this path will be used for the program to run with B<-t>
rather than the default compiled into B<krenew>.

If no ticket file (with B<-k>) or command is specified on the command
line, B<krenew> will use the environment variable KRB5CCNAME to determine
the location of the the ticket granting ticket.  If the B<-k> option is
used, KRB5CCNAME will be set to point to the ticket file before running
the B<aklog> program or any command given on the command line.

=head1 FILES

The default ticket cache is determined by the underlying Kerberos
libraries.  The default path for aklog is determined at build time, and
will normally be whichever of B<aklog> or B<afslog> is found in the user's
path.

=head1 AUTHORS

B<krenew> was written by Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>.  It was based
heavily on B<k5start> by Booker C. Bense, which in turn was based on the
k4start code written by Robert Morgan.
