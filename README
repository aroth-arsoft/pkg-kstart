DESCRIPTION

  kstart (for Kerberos v4) and k5start (for Kerberos v5) are modified
  versions of kinit.  They can be used as a substitute for kinit (with
  better command-line handling than the old Kerberos v4 kinit), but they
  can also obtain credentials automatically from a v4 srvtab or a v5
  keytab.  They can run as a daemon, waking up periodically to refresh
  credentials using that srvtab or keytab, and can also check for the
  validity of tickets and only refresh if they're no longer valid.

  Some of these capabilities have been included in Kerberos v5's kinit,
  but the ability to maintain tickets while running as a daemon has not
  and is useful for servers that need to use Kerberos.  Using kstart
  allows the ticket handling to be moved out of the server into a separate
  process dedicated just to that purpose.

  kstart and k5start can optionally run an external program whenever the
  ticket is refreshed to obtain an AFS token, and therefore can be used in
  conjunction with a program like aklog or afslog to maintain an AFS
  token.


REQUIREMENTS

  As Kerberos programs, kstart and k5start require Kerberos libraries to
  link against.  They have only been tested with the MIT Kerberos
  libraries, but there is no reason why they could not also be made to
  work with Heimdall and KTH Kerberos v4.  This may, however, require some
  porting.  If you do this work, patches are welcome.  k5start, when
  compiled by itself, requires only Kerberos v5 libraries.

  Other than that, all you should need is a suitable C compiler.  Neither
  program has been tested on non-Unix systems.

  If you want the -t option to work, you need a program to obtain AFS
  tokens from Kerberos tickets.  You can specify the program to use on
  your system with the --with-aklog option to configure; if that option is
  not given, the first of aklog or afslog that is found on your path will
  be used.


INSTALLATION

  Basic installation is simple.  Just run:

      ./configure
      make
      make install

  This will build kstart and k5start and install them in /usr/local/bin
  with man pages in /usr/local/man/man1.  You may need to be root to run
  make install.  To install in a different location, specify a different
  location with the --prefix option to configure, as in:

      ./configure --prefix=/opt/sw

  Binaries would then be installed in /opt/sw/bin and man pages in
  /opt/sw/man/man1.  Alternately, --bindir and --mandir can be given to
  change the installation locations of the binaries and manual pages
  separately.

  If your Kerberos libraries aren't installed in a location found by your
  compiler by default, use the --with-kerberos=PATH option to configure.
  The Kerberos libraries will then be expected in PATH/lib and the headers
  in PATH/include.

  If you are using aklog, afslog, or some other program to obtain AFS
  tokens, give its path to configure with the --with-aklog option, as in:

      ./configure --with-aklog=/usr/local/bin/aklog

  This program will be run when the -t option is given to kstart or
  k5start.

  Finally, to link statically against the Kerberos libraries rather than
  dynamically (so that the binaries can be used on systems without
  Kerberos libraries installed, for example, or so that they're
  independent of shared libraries installed in AFS or NFS), give the
  --enable-static option to configure.  This has been tested on Solaris
  and Linux.
