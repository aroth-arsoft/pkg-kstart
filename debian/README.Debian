kstart for Debian
-----------------

k4start is only useful for people who are still running a native Kerberos
v4 realm, something that you probably don't want to be doing.  Most sites
will only use k5start.

If you also use AFS, both k4start and k5start are compiled to run
/usr/bin/aklog to obtain an AFS token if requested with the -t option.
The openafs-krb5 and arla packages both provide this program.  If you want
to use afslog from heimdal-clients or kafslog from kerberos4kth-clients
instead, set the environment variable KINIT_PROG (named this for legacy
reasons) to the full path to that program.  (You can also set that
environment variable to the full path to any other local program you have
for obtaining an AFS token from a Kerberos ticket.)
