                            kstart To-Do List

General:

 * k4start, k5start, and krenew have almost identical structure.  Redesign
   them to use a standard driver frontend with callbacks for the things
   that differ between the three programs, which will significantly reduce
   code duplication.

k5start:

 * Add the -F and -P flags to k5start to override library defaults for
   forwardable and proxiable tickets.

 * Add support to k5start for obtaining K4 tickets in addition to K5
   tickets, using the DES key in a keytab.

Documentation:

 * Document how to start Apache with tickets and AFS tokens, either using
   k5start in the init script or the non-PAG method we use at Stanford.
   Probably take some information from the Stanford web page documenting
   using tokens with servers.

Test suite:

 * Run the test suite under Heimdal and adjust it for any differences in
   command output of things like klist.

 * Test more of krenew's basic functionality, preferrably by parsing klist
   output more thoroughly and seeing if tickets really were renewed.

 * Test that -K and running a command wakes up periodically and renews
   tickets for both krenew and k5start.

 * Test propagation of exit status from commands in k5start and krenew.

 * Add tests for k4start and k5start password prompting, either from
   standard input or from a TTY.

 * Add error tests for invalid combinations of command-line options or
   invalid settings for those options in k4start, k5start, and krenew.

 * Add tests of -o, -g, and -m.  Testing -o and -g will require using
   fakeroot.
