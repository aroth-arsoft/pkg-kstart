.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBk4start\fR obtains and caches an initial Kerberos v4 ticket-granting
ticket for a principal.  \fBk4start\fR can be used as an alternative to
\&\fBkinit\fR, but it is primarily intended to be used by programs that want to
use a srvtab to obtain Kerberos credentials, such as a web server that
needs to authenticate to another service such as an \s-1LDAP\s0 server or to \s-1AFS\s0.
.PP
Normally, the principal for which to give tickets should be specified as
the first argument.  The \fB\-u\fR and \fB\-i\fR options can be used as an
alternative mechanism for specifying the principal, but generally aren't
as convenient.  If no username is given as either the first argument or
the argument to the \fB\-u\fR option, the client principal defaults to the
Unix username of the user running \fBk4start\fR in the default local realm.
.PP
Optionally, a command may be given on the command line of \fBk4start\fR.  If
so, that command is run after Kerberos authentication (and running
\&\fBaklog\fR if desired), with the appropriate environment variables set to
point it to the right ticket cache.  \fBk4start\fR will then continue
running, waking up periodically to refresh credentials slightly before
they would expire, until the command completes.  (The frequency with which
it wakes up to refresh credentials can still be controlled with the \fB\-K\fR
option.)  To run in this mode, the principal must be specified as a
regular command-line argument rather than using the \fB\-u\fR and \fB\-i\fR
options and a srvtab must be specified with \fB\-f\fR.
.PP
The command will not be run using the shell, so if you want to use shell
metacharacters in the command with their special meaning, give \f(CW\*(C`sh \-c
\&\f(CIcommand\f(CW\*(C'\fR as the command to run and quote \fIcommand\fR.
.PP
If the command contains command-line options (like \f(CW\*(C`\-c\*(C'\fR), put \*(-- on the
command line before the beginning of the command to tell \fBk4start\fR to not
parse those options as its own.
.PP
When running a command, \fBk4start\fR propagates \s-1HUP\s0, \s-1TERM\s0, and \s-1QUIT\s0 signals
to the child process and does not exit when those signals are received.
(If the propagated signal causes the child process to exit, \fBk4start\fR
will then exit.)  This allows \fBk4start\fR to react properly when run under
a command supervision system such as \fIrunit\fR\|(8) or \fIsvscan\fR\|(8) that uses
signals to control supervised commands.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-b\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b"
After starting, detach from the controlling terminal and run in the
background.  This option only makes sense in combination with \fB\-K\fR or a
command that \fBk4start\fR will be running and can only be used if a srvtab
is specified with \fI\-f\fR.  \fBk4start\fR will not background itself until
after it does the initial authentication, so that any initial errors will
be reported, but it will then redirect output to \fI/dev/null\fR and no
subsequent errors will be reported.
.Sp
If this flag is given, \fBk4start\fR will also change directories to \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR.
All paths (such as to a command to run or a \s-1PID\s0 file) should therefore be
given as absolute, not relative, paths.
.Sp
If used in conjunction with a command to run, that command will also run
in the background and will also have its input and output redirected to
\&\fI/dev/null\fR.  It will have to report any errors via some other mechanism
for the errors to be seen.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR \fIchild pid file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c child pid file"
Save the process \s-1ID\s0 (\s-1PID\s0) of the child process into \fIchild pid file\fR.
\&\fIchild pid file\fR is created if it doesn't exist and overwritten if it
does exist.  This option is only allowed when a command was given on the
command line and is most useful in conjunction with \fB\-b\fR to allow
management of the running child process.
.Sp
Note that, when used with \fB\-b\fR, the \s-1PID\s0 file is written out after
\&\fBk4start\fR is backgrounded and changes its working directory to \fI/\fR, so
relative paths for the \s-1PID\s0 file will be relative to \fI/\fR (probably not
what you want).
.IP "\fB\-f\fR \fIsrvtab\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f srvtab"
Authenticate using the srvtab \fIsrvtab\fR rather than asking for a password.
.IP "\fB\-g\fR \fIgroup\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g group"
After creating the ticket cache, change its group ownership to \fIgroup\fR,
which may be either the name of a group or a numeric group \s-1ID\s0.  Ticket
caches are created with \f(CW0600\fR permissions by default, so this will have
no useful effect unless used with \fB\-m\fR.
.Sp
If this option is used with a command or with the \fB\-K\fR option, there may
be a short window after each authentication during which the group
ownership of the cache will be the default group of the \fBk4start\fR
process.
.IP "\fB\-H\fR \fIminutes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-H minutes"
Check for a happy ticket, defined as one that has a remaining lifetime of
at least \fIminutes\fR minutes.  If such a ticket is found, do not attempt
authentication.  Instead, just run the command (if one was specified) or
exit immediately with status 0 (if none was).  Otherwise, try to obtain a
new ticket and then run the command, if any.  Cannot be used with \fB\-K\fR.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h"
Display a usage message and exit.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR \fIservice instance\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I service instance"
The instance portion of the service principal.  The default is the default
realm of the machine.  Note that unlike the client principal, a
non-default service principal must be specified with \fB\-I\fR and \fB\-S\fR; one
cannot provide the instance portion as part of the argument to \fB\-S\fR.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR \fIclient instance\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i client instance"
Specifies the instance portion of the principal.  This option doesn't make
sense except in combination with \fB\-u\fR.  Note that the instance can be
specified as part of \fIusername\fR through the normal convention of
appending a period and then the instance, so one never has to use this
option.
.IP "\fB\-K\fR \fIminutes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-K minutes"
Run in daemon mode to keep a ticket alive indefinitely.  The program
reawakens after \fIminutes\fR minutes, checks if the ticket will expire
before or less than two minutes after the next scheduled check, and gets a
new ticket if needed.
.IP "\fB\-k\fR \fIticket file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-k ticket file"
Use \fIticket file\fR as the ticket cache rather than the contents of the
environment variable \s-1KRBTKFILE\s0 or the library default.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR \fIminutes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l minutes"
Set the ticket lifetime in minutes.  Note that if the ticket lifetime will
only be accurate to within five minutes, may be approximate if the ticket
lifetime is over ten hours, and cannot be more than about 21 hours unless
your Kerberos libraries support long ticket lifetimes.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR \fImode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m mode"
After creating the ticket cache, change its file permissions to \fImode\fR,
which must be a file mode in octal (\f(CW640\fR or \f(CW444\fR, for example).
.Sp
If this option is used with a command or with the \fB\-K\fR option, there may
be a short window after each authentication during which the file
permissions of the ticket cache will be \f(CW600\fR.  Setting a \fImode\fR that
does not allow \fBk4start\fR to read or write to the ticket cache will cause
\&\fBk4start\fR to fail and exit when using the \fB\-K\fR option or running a
command.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n"
Regardless of the setting of the environment variables \s-1AKLOG\s0 and
\&\s-1KINIT_PROG\s0, don't run the program.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIowner\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o owner"
After creating the ticket cache, change its ownership to \fIowner\fR, which
may be either the name of a user or a numeric user \s-1ID\s0.  If \fIowner\fR is
the name of a user and \fB\-g\fR was not also given, also change the group
ownership of the ticket cache to the default group for that user.
.Sp
If this option is used with a command or with the \fB\-K\fR option, there may
be a short window after each authentication during which the ownership of
the cache will be the user the \fBk4start\fR process is running as.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR \fIpid file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p pid file"
Save the process \s-1ID\s0 (\s-1PID\s0) of the running \fBk4start\fR process into \fIpid
file\fR.  \fIpid file\fR is created if it doesn't exist and overwritten if it
does exist.  This option is most useful in conjunction with \fB\-b\fR to allow
management of the running \fBk4start\fR daemon.
.Sp
Note that, when used with \fB\-b\fR the \s-1PID\s0 file is written out after
\&\fBk4start\fR is backgrounded and changes its working directory to \fI/\fR, so
relative paths for the \s-1PID\s0 file will be relative to \fI/\fR (probably not
what you want).
.IP "\fB\-q\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q"
Quiet.  Suppresses the printing of the initial banner message saying what
Kerberos principal tickets are being obtained for, and also suppresses the
password prompt when the \fB\-s\fR option is given.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR \fIservice realm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r service realm"
The realm for the service principal.  This defaults to the default local
realm.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR \fIservice name\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S service name"
Specifies the principal for which \fBk4start\fR is getting a service ticket.
The default value is \f(CW\*(C`krbtgt\*(C'\fR, to obtain a ticket-granting ticket.  This
option (along with \fB\-I\fR) may be used if one only needs access to a single
service.  Note that unlike the client principal, a non-default service
principal must be specified with both \fB\-S\fR and \fB\-I\fR; one cannot provide
the instance portion as part of the argument to \fB\-S\fR.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s"
Read the password from standard input.  This bypasses the normal password
prompt, which means echo isn't suppressed and input isn't forced to be
from the controlling terminal.  Most uses of this option are a security
risk.  You normally want to use a srvtab and the \fB\-f\fR option instead.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t"
Run an external program after getting a \s-1TGT\s0.  The default use of this is
to run \fBaklog\fR to get a token.  If the environment variable \s-1KINIT_PROG\s0 is
set, the program is run regardless of the \fB\-t\fR flag (unless the \fB\-n\fR
flag is given).
.Sp
If \fBk4start\fR has been built with \s-1AFS\s0 \fIsetpag()\fR support and a command was
given on the command line, \fBk4start\fR will create a new \s-1PAG\s0 before
obtaining \s-1AFS\s0 tokens.  Otherwise, it will obtain tokens in the current
\&\s-1PAG\s0.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR \fIclient principal\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u client principal"
This specifies the principal to obtain credentials as.  The entire
principal may be specified here, or alternatively just the first portion
may be specified with this flag and the instance specified with \fB\-i\fR.
.Sp
Note that there's normally no reason to use this flag rather than simply
giving the principal on the command line as the first regular argument.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v"
Be verbose.  This will print out a bit of additional information about
what is being attempted and what the results are.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
The program exits with status 0 if it successfully gets a ticket or has a
happy ticket (see \fB\-H\fR).  If \fBk4start\fR runs aklog or some other program
\&\fBk4start\fR returns the exit status of that program.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
Use the \fI/etc/srvtab\fR srvtab to obtain a ticket granting ticket for the
principal \f(CW\*(C`rcmd.example\*(C'\fR, putting the ticket cache in
\&\fI/tmp/service.tgt\fR.  The lifetime is 600 minutes and the program wakes up
every 10 minutes to check if the ticket is about to expire.
.PP

.Ve
.PP
Notice the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR before the command to keep \fBk4start\fR from parsing the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-c\*(C'\fR as its own option.
.PP
Starts \fBk4start\fR as a daemon using the Debian \fBstart-stop-daemon\fR
management program.  This is the sort of line that one could put into a
Debian init script:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    start\-stop\-daemon \-\-start \-\-pidfile /var/run/k4start.pid \e
\&        \-\-exec /usr/local/bin/k4start \-\- \-b \-p /var/run/k4start.pid \e
\&        \-f /etc/srvtab rcmd.example
.Ve
.PP
This uses \fI/var/run/k4start.pid\fR as the \s-1PID\s0 file and obtains
\&\f(CW\*(C`rcmd.example\*(C'\fR tickets from the system srvtab file.  \fBk4start\fR would
then be stopped with:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    start\-stop\-daemon \-\-stop \-\-pidfile /var/run/k4start.pid
\&    rm \-f /var/run/k4start.pid
.Ve
.PP
This code could be added to an init script for Apache, for example, to
start a \fBk4start\fR process alongside Apache to manage its Kerberos
credentials.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
If the environment variable \s-1AKLOG\s0 is set, its value will be taken as the
path to a program and that program will be automatically executed after
the ticket-granting ticket has been retrieved (unless \fB\-n\fR was given).
If \s-1AKLOG\s0 is not set and \s-1KINIT_PROG\s0 is set, its value will be used instead.
\&\s-1KINIT_PROG\s0 is honored for backward compatibility but its use is not
recommended due to its confusing name.
.PP
If no ticket file (with \fB\-k\fR) or command is specified on the command
line, \fBk4start\fR will use the environment variable \s-1KRBTKFILE\s0 to determine
the location of the the ticket granting ticket.  If either a command is
specified or the \fB\-k\fR option is used, \s-1KRBTKFILE\s0 will be set to point to
that file before running the \fBaklog\fR program or any command given on the
command line.
.SH "FILES"
.IX Header "FILES"
The default ticket cache is determined by the underlying Kerberos
libraries.  The default path for aklog is determined at build time, and
will normally be whichever of \fBaklog\fR or \fBafslog\fR is found in the user's
path.
.PP
If a command is specified and \fB\-k\fR was not given, \fBk4start\fR will create
a temporary ticket cache file of the form \f(CW\*(C`/tmp/tkt%d_%s\*(C'\fR where \f(CW%d\fR is the
\&\s-1UID\s0 \fBk4start\fR is running as and \f(CW%s\fR is a random string.
