# An interesting command to run under k5start or krenew to perform various
# tests.  It takes on the command-line a file into which to write, and into
# that file, it puts its PID, its current working directory, and its ticket
# cache.  When it gets a HUP signal, it writes into that file.  When it gets a
# TERM signal, it writes into that file and exits.
