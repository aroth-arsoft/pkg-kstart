kstart/k5start release 2.0 (2002-12-29)

    First release that includes k5start, an equivalent version of kstart

    Added a fudge factor to make sure the ticket is refreshed before it

    Diagnose errors when running aklog.  Better portability and use of
    Autoconf.

    -k options.

    Change default location of aklog and documentation fixes.
