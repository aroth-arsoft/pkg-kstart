                            kstart To-Do List

 * Add to the krenew man page an example that requires using sh -c.

 * Add a test suite.  Given a keytab and/or srvtab and some configuration
   about the realm, test obtaining tickets from a keytab, obtaining
   tickets from a srvtab, creating a PAG, and running aklog.  Also check
   all of the POD documentation source in the package for syntax errors.

 * Add the -F and -P flags to k5start to override library defaults for
   forwardable and proxiable tickets.

 * k4start, k5start, and krenew have almost identical structure.  Redesign
   them to use a standard driver frontend with callbacks for the things
   that differ between the three programs, which will significantly reduce
   code duplication.

 * Add support to k5start for obtaining K4 tickets in addition to K5
   tickets, using the DES key in a keytab.
